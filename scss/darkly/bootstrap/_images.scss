// Responsive images (ensure images don't scale beyond their parents)
//
// This is purposefully opt-in via an explicit class rather than being the default for all `<img>`s.
// We previously tried the "images are responsive by default" approach in Bootstrap v2,
// and abandoned it in Bootstrap v3 because it breaks lots of third-party widgets (including Google Maps)
// which weren't expecting the images within themselves to be involuntarily resized.
